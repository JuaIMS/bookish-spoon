# Multiplexing 3 Segment Display

This is a test project for multiplexing 3 segment display using Arduino.

Some of the important PlatformIO CLI commands are:

1. `pio run`: Build and upload the firmware to the board.
2. `pio test`: Run unit tests.
3. `pio ci`: Continuous integration.
4. `pio run -t compiledb`: Generate compile database for IDE integration. VERY IMPORTANT FOR IDES LIKE ZED.
