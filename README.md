# Multiplexing E-Bike Specific Segment Display

This is a test project for multiplexing 3 segment display using Arduino.

## Display
The display I have used for this project can be found on [robu](https://robu.in/product/high-brightness-digital-screen-for-electric-scooter/#).

I don't know where else to find this display. It seems like this display is a custom built one for a company.

The only identifiable thing about this display is the fact that it has _201217_ printed on it's side. Googling it won't land on any relevant results, at least in my case.

### Display Resources:
As mentioned above, this display is custom built and hence, there is very little publicly available info (by that I mean close to none) about this type of display, it's pin-out and it's electrical characteristics. I have done my best to document the pin-out of this display.

There is a PDF document in the project file that gives you the specific combination to light up each segment that is referenced in the above image by number.
